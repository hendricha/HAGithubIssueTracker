HAGitHubIssueTracker
====================

An iOS application that let's you add tasks to issues on github. And throw around these tasks Kanban Board style.
This was a simple project that I had to for my university studies, so don't expect the best experience. I might fix some basic stuff (see [issues](https://github.com/hendricha/HAGithubIssueTracker/issues)), but it's highly unlikely that this will ever be a full fledged app.

Installing
----------
- Run "pod install" in the project root. (Therefore it need cocoa-pods installed and configured.)
- Then simply open the workspace created by pod, and build it.
